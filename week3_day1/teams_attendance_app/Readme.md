# Teams Attendance app

## High Level Overview

Multiple Teams send Attendance Report to our shared folder on daily basis. 

The file format is csv  but values are tab separated values

Multiple files for the same date **mm/dd/yyy** can arrive the same day, and they can contain same data

Your work consist on developing a console app that allows the user to answer the following questions

- What is the number of Partipants attending General Meeting per date, date filter between 9/12/2022 and 9/16/2022?
- What is the Meeting duration of General Meeting per date, date filter between between 9/12/2022 and 9/16/2022?

## App overview

When the user launches the app you need to present a menu of "template" questions allowing the user to select the question and then input required data for the selected question; once the required input data is entered then the app will do its works and respond the user by printing the answer in pretty json format and also writing it to json file

**Questions template**
- What is the number of Partipants attending **{meeting_name}** Meeting per date, date filter between **{start_date}** and **{end_date}**
- What is the duration of **{meeting_name}** Meeting per date, date filter between **{start_date}** and **{end_date}****
